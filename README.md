For testing:
install all dependencies on both `client` and `server` folders using ``npm install`` on their directories.

On the client terminal:
> run `npm start`

On the server terminal:
> run `npx prisma generate` first, and then `npm run build`

Once installed, use `npm start` on the client terminal, and `npm run start` on the server terminal.

Currently, the server is located at `http://localhost:3001`, while the client is on `http://localhost:3000`.
The database is live on a Planetscale database. If you need access to it, send me a message so i can add you to the team there.
