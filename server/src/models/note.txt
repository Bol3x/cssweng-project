There's no explicit types here since Prisma generates their own types.

I'm not sure how to generalize their types into an abstract type here so,
If we're using tight coupling with Prisma, then this shouldn't be a problem.
Access to their generated types can be done with 
`import { Type } from '@prisma/client'`
